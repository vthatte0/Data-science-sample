# Data-science-sample

This notebook shows my work in answering the following questions:

1. suggest which products should be dropped from selling in the next year moving forward and which products should be sold more. Should any region be given preference over the other?
hint: look at the profitability

2. Which products are the easiest to sell. (hint: look at the ship date and order date) by region. Is there a relationship between products or region

In some cases, multiple approaches to questions will be shown.

The following python libraries will need to be installed in order to run the notebook:

pandas
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
datetime
